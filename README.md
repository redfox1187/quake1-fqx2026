# FQX2026 – FQX for Quake Rerelease

FQX2026 is a fresh QuakeC project built on the
[Quake Rerelease QuakeC Source Code (QRQCSC)](https://github.com/id-Software/quake-rerelease-qc).

**Goals**

- Keep strict compatibility with the Quake Rerelease (KEX) runtime.
- Implement a lighter, engine-safe evolution of the original FQX design.
- Use all prior FQX work as reference only – no dragging old corruption forward.

**Status**

- Base: clean QRQCSC import.
- Scope: deliberately constrained to stay within classic Quake engine limits.
- Advanced systems (Monster Core, heavy AMS, bots): considered out-of-scope or “Phase 3+” until proven safe.

> This repository contains *code only*. You must own a legal copy of Quake to play this mod.
